                        Debotakhum is located in Roangchhari upazila of Bandarban district. Natural Bandarban is said to be the paradise of Khum and the crown of excellence of this kingdom will undoubtedly go to Devatakhum. According to the locals, this khum is about 50-60 feet deep and 600 feet long which is much bigger than Velakhum and much more wild. If you want to go to Devtakhum, first you have to go from Roangchhari to Kachhapatli Army Camp and trek to Shilbandha Para (Liragaon) with permission. Of course, you have to make a strong bamboo valve from the sealed area.
